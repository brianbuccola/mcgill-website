About
-----

I am a Ph.D. student in linguistics at [McGill University][dept]. My research
interests primarily include formal semantics, pragmatics, phonology, and
computational linguistics.

My dissertation, supervised by [Luis Alonso-Ovalle][lao] and [Bernhard
Schwarz][bs], investigates the source of downward monotonicity of modified
numerals like "less than five". I argue that downward monotonicity arises from a
special interaction between several key ingredients: the lexical semantics of
the numeral modifier, the distributivity properties of the NP and VP predicates
it combines with, and a separate, optional maximization operation, whose
application is pragmatically constrained.

In addition to my doctoral research, I have also worked on ignorance inferences
associated with superlative numeral/scalar modifiers like "at least" and "at
most".  On the phonology side, I have worked on the difference in generative
capacity between Optimality Theory and ordered rewrite rules.

Apart from linguistics, I enjoy tinkering with Linux, learning about functional
programming (like Haskell), and (when I have time) brewing beer. I have a
[personal blog][blog] where I write about language, math, Linux, and other
random stuff that comes to mind.
