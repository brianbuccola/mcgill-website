About
-----

I am a Ph.D. student in linguistics at [McGill University][dept]. My research
interests primarily include formal semantics, pragmatics, phonology, and
computational linguistics.

On the semantics/pragmatics side, I have worked on ignorance inferences
associated with superlative numeral/scalar modifiers like "at least" and "at
most".  On the phonology side, I have worked on the difference in generative
capacity between Optimality Theory and ordered rewrite rules.

Apart from linguistics, I enjoy tinkering with Linux, learning about functional
programming (like Haskell), and (when I have time) brewing beer. I have a
[personal blog][blog] where I write about language, math, linux, and other
random stuff that comes to mind.

Recent/Upcoming
---------------

- On 9 November 2013, I'll be at the [Phonology 2013][phon2013] poster session
  presenting joint work with [Morgan Sonderegger][MS] on the expressivity of OT
  with respect to various types of phonological opacity.
- On 11 August 2013, I presented my work on the expressivity of OT vs. rewrite
  rules at [Formal Grammar][fg].
- From 5-16 August 2013, I attended [ESSLLI][esslli] (collocated with FG),
  where I took courses in [inquisitive semantics][inq] by [Donka Farkas][donka]
  and [Floris Roelofsen][floris], in speech act theory by [Sarah Murray][sarah]
  and [Will Starr][will], and in the "psychological reality of semantic
  theories" by [Hans Kamp][hans], among many others.
