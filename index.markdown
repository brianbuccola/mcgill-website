About
-----

I am a Ph.D. student in linguistics at [McGill University][dept]. My main areas
of research are formal semantics, pragmatics, the syntax-semantics interface,
and computational linguistics.

Most of my research in semantics revolves around the interpretation of
quantificational expressions, especially so-called modified numerals, like
*fewer than five*, *at least three*, and *up to ten*. My dissertation looks at
how expressions like *fewer/less than five* seems to mean different things
depending on the type (distributive vs. non-distributive) of nominal and verbal
arguments it combines with. Previously, I have also worked on ignorance
inferences associated with superlative modifiers like *at least* and *at most*,
as well as on the semantic and pragmatic differences between *at most* and *up
to*.

I am also interested in the formal properties of formal grammars. I have worked
in particular on the differences in generative capacity between Optimality
Theory and ordered rewrite rules.

Apart from linguistics, I enjoy tinkering with Linux, learning about functional
programming (like Haskell), and (when I have time) brewing beer. I have a
[personal blog][blog] where I write about language, math, Linux, and other
random stuff that comes to mind.
