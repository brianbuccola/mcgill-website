About
-----

I am a Ph.D. student in linguistics at [McGill University][dept]. My research
interests primarily include formal semantics, pragmatics, phonology, and
computational linguistics.

On the semantics/pragmatics side, I have worked on ignorance inferences
associated with superlative quantifiers like "at least *m*" and "at most *n*".
On the phonology side, I have worked on the formal expressive difference
between Optimality Theory and ordered rewrite rules.

Apart from linguistics, I enjoy tinkering with Linux, learning about functional
programming (like Haskell), and (when I have time) brewing beer. I have a
[personal blog][blog] where I write about language, math, linux, and other
random stuff that comes to mind.
