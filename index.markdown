About
-----

I am a linguist whose research interests lie mainly in formal semantics,
pragmatics, the syntax-semantics interface, and mathematical linguistics.
Currently, I am a fellow at the [Language, Logic, and Cognition Center][llcc]
of the [Hebrew University of Jerusalem][huji]. Before that, I completed my
doctoral work at [McGill University][mcgill].

Most of my research in semantics revolves around the interpretation of
quantificational expressions, especially so-called modified numerals, like
*fewer than five*, *at least three*, *up to ten*, and *between 20 and 30*. My
dissertation looks at how expressions like *less than five* and *between three
and five* seem to mean different things depending on the type (distributive vs.
non-distributive) of nominal and verbal arguments they combines with.
Previously, I have also worked on ignorance inferences associated with
superlative modifiers like *at least* and *at most*, as well as on the semantic
and pragmatic differences between *at most* and *up to*.

I am also interested in the formal properties of formal grammars. I have worked
in particular on the differences in generative capacity between Optimality
Theory and ordered rewrite rules.

Apart from linguistics, I enjoy tinkering with Linux, learning about functional
programming (like Haskell), and (when I have time) brewing beer. I have a
[personal blog][blog] where I write about language, math, Linux, and other
random stuff that comes to mind.
