About
-----

I am a Ph.D. student in linguistics at [McGill University][dept]. My research
interests primarily include formal semantics, pragmatics, phonology, and
computational linguistics.

For my first evaluation paper, I studied the epistemic inferences that speakers
make when they encounter superlative numeral quantifiers like "at least *m*"
and "at most *n*" and how such inferences should be modeled in
semantic--pragmatic theory. I drew a connection between certain puzzling
inferences involving superlative quantifiers, on the one hand, and
non--monotonic inferences involving overt epistemic modals, on the other hand,
such as the reasonable but defeasible inference from "Bob went to Italy" that
Bob may have gone to Rome.

For my second evaluation paper, I gave a mathematical demonstration that there
exist phonological patterns (namely, certain ones among those traditionally
called *opaque*) which can be expressed by ordered rewrite rules but which
cannot be expressed by "classic" Optimality Theoretic grammars, under any set
of constraints, under any ranking. By a classic OT grammar, I mean one which
recognizes just two levels of representation (underlying and surface) and just
two types of constraints (markedness and basic faithfulness).

Apart from linguistics, I enjoy tinkering with Linux, learning about functional
programming (like Haskell), listening to early American blues and jazz, and
(when I have time) brewing beer. I have a [personal blog][blog] where I write
about language, math, linux, and other random stuff that comes to mind.
